################# Q's to Consider ##########################
Is it possible to reconstruct each tree? How do you know?
	Yes, but there may be multiple solutions.
	
For each pair of traversals given, could they have come from but 1 tree? 0 trees? Many trees? Justify your response.
	Tree 2 has 4 possible solutions - is this only when we don't have in-order traverse?

What info does each traversal convey? What information does a pair of traversals, taken together, convey?
	PRE-ORDER print parents before children
	POST-ORDER prints children before parents
	IN-ORDER prints the tree left-to-right irregardless of level/layer
